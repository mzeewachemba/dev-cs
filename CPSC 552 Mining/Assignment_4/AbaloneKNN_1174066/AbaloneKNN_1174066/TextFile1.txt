1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data:
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize or standardize features if necessary
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Choose the value of k (number of neighbors)
4. For each instance in the test set:
   - Calculate the distance between the test instance and all instances in the training set
   - Sort the distances and select the k instances with the smallest distances
   - Determine the majority class among the k nearest neighbors
   - Assign the test instance to the majority class
5. Evaluate the model's performance:
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other relevant metrics
   - Optionally, tune hyperparameters such as k or distance metrics using cross-validation
6. Repeat steps 3-5 with different values of k or other parameters to optimize the model
7. Once satisfied with the model's performance, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
